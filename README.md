# Coding-Quiz
This is a small coding quiz to hold and test on information learned through the UW Full Stacked Bootcamp!

Description

The objective of this project was to create a workable quiz website that allows users to interact by answering questions within a certain time frame. Their score will be direcly linked with how fast and accurate they can answer. This website was made during the fourth week of the bootcamp where we are not focusing on building a website using JavaScript, and also build on the HTML and CSS skills that we have learned as well. 

Here is the link to the page:

Here is what the main page should look like:

The main page will have a quick overview of the objective of the game. Players will get 60 seconds to answer as fast and accurate as they can. As soon as they click the "start game" button, a new page will pop up with a series of questions for them to answer. Answer a question wrong and 15 seconds will be deducted from the clock! If they are able to finish before the time run out, they have the opportunity to input their initials to save their score!
